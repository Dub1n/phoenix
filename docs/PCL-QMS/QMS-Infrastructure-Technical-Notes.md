- Risk management integration
- Software verification and validation
- Software maintenance processes
- Problem resolution processes

**AAMI TIR45-2023 Agile Practices:**

- Agile-compliant documentation strategies
- Iterative development within regulatory constraints
- Risk-based approach to documentation
- Continuous integration with regulatory requirements
- Stakeholder collaboration in regulated environments

**SSI Standard Operating Procedures:**

- **SSI-SOP-10**: Design and Development Control (50+ forms and templates)
- **SSI-SOP-20**: Software Development specific procedures
- Traceability matrix requirements
- Design verification and validation protocols
- Change control processes

### Compliance Strategies

1. **Systematic Document Processing**: Convert existing PDF-based QMS documents to structured, searchable formats
2. **Traceability Integration**: Implement requirement traceability from system level to implementation
3. **Agile-Regulatory Bridge**: Adapt agile development practices to maintain regulatory compliance
4. **Risk-Based Documentation**: Focus documentation efforts based on software safety classification
5. **Continuous Compliance**: Integrate compliance checking into development workflows

## Document Processing Decisions

### Technology Choices for PDF Processing

**Selected Approach: Hybrid Processing Strategy:**

1. **PDF Text Extraction**:
   - **Tool**: `pdftotext` (available via Git installation)
   - **Rationale**: Reliable text extraction, command-line integration, cross-platform compatibility
   - **Fallback**: Manual conversion for complex formatted documents

2. **Structured Data Extraction**:
   - **Tool**: Custom parsing scripts with regex patterns
   - **Rationale**: Medical device forms have standardized structures suitable for pattern matching
   - **Alternative**: OCR for image-based PDFs if needed

3. **Markdown Conversion Strategy**:
   - **Format**: GitHub-flavored markdown for maximum compatibility
   - **Structure**: Preserve document hierarchy and formatting
   - **Metadata**: Extract and preserve document version, revision, and approval information

### Conversion Workflows

    D --> E[Markdown Generation]
    E --> F[Quality Validation]
    F --> G[Structured Repository]
```

**Process Steps:**

1. **Batch Processing**: Process entire SSI-SOP directories
2. **Structure Detection**: Identify forms, procedures, checklists
3. **Content Categorization**: Classify by document type and regulatory scope
4. **Cross-Reference Resolution**: Maintain document relationships and dependencies
5. **Version Management**: Track document revisions and change history

## Infrastructure Architecture

### System Design Decisions

**Architecture Pattern: Plugin-Based Extension:**

- Maintains Phoenix-Code-Lite foundation while adding QMS-specific capabilities
- Modular design allows independent development of QMS features
- Preserves existing TDD workflow orchestration capabilities

### Component Integration Patterns

```typescript
// QMS Infrastructure Architecture
interface QMSInfrastructure {
  documentProcessor: DocumentProcessingEngine;
  complianceTracker: ComplianceValidationSystem;

// Integration with existing Phoenix-Code-Lite components
interface SystemIntegration {
  claudeIntegration: ClaudeCodeSDKAdapter;
  tddOrchestrator: TDDWorkflowEngine;
  auditLogger: ComplianceAuditLogger;
  configManager: QMSConfigurationManager;
}
```

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Separation of Concerns**: QMS functionality isolated in dedicated modules
2. **Configuration-Driven**: QMS-specific templates and settings
3. **Audit Trail**: Enhanced logging for regulatory compliance
4. **Security by Design**: Sensitive document handling with access controls
5. **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for future QMS enhancements

### Technology Stack Adaptations
