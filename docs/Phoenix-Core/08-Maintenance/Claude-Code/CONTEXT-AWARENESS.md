phoenix-code-lite help generate
phoenix-code-lite generate --help

# Configuration hierarchy
phoenix-code-lite config --show
phoenix-code-lite config --template enterprise
phoenix-code-lite config --edit
```

### 2. Progress and Feedback Patterns

Users need to understand what's happening during long-running operations.

#### 2.1 Feedback Requirements

- **Immediate Acknowledgment**: Confirm command was received
- **Progress Indication**: Show what's currently happening
- **Time Estimation**: When possible, indicate expected completion
- **Success/Failure Clarity**: Clear indication of outcomes

#### 2.2 Implementation Patterns

```typescript
// Progress tracking example
const tracker = new ProgressTracker(['Plan & Test', 'Implement & Fix', 'Refactor & Document']);
tracker.startPhase('Plan & Test');
// ... work happens
tracker.completePhase(true);
tracker.startPhase('Implement & Fix');
```

### 3. Error Recovery Patterns

When things go wrong, users need clear paths to resolution.

#### 3.1 Error Recovery Hierarchy

1. **Prevention**: Validate inputs to prevent errors
2. **Graceful Handling**: When errors occur, handle them gracefully
3. **Clear Communication**: Explain what went wrong and why
4. **Recovery Options**: Provide actionable next steps
5. **Learning**: Help users avoid similar issues

#### 3.2 Error Context Examples

```typescript
// Good error context
throw new ValidationError(
  'Task description too short',
  {
    received: taskDescription,
    minimum: 10,
    suggestion: 'Try: "Create a function that validates email addresses"'
  }
);

// Bad error context
throw new Error('Invalid input');
```
