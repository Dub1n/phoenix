# PCL-QMS High Level Explanation

> *07/08/2025*

Think of PCL-QMS as a smart, automated assistant that helps medical device companies manage their quality documents and compliance requirements - similar to how you might use Word templates and Excel spreadsheets, but much more intelligent and connected.

What It Replaces in Your Current World

Instead of...

- Word documents scattered across folders with version control issues
- Excel spreadsheets tracking requirements, tests, and compliance manually
- Email chains for document reviews and approvals
- Manual copying of information between different documents
- Hunting through folders to find the right template or document

You get...

- Intelligent document management that knows what goes where
- Automated requirement tracking that connects everything together
- Smart templates that fill themselves out based on your project
- Real-time compliance checking that tells you what's missing
- Searchable knowledge base of all your quality documents

How It Works - Like a Smart Office Suite

1. Document Intelligence (Better than Word Templates)
    - Instead of static Word templates, PCL-QMS provides living templates that adapt
    - When you start a new medical device project, it automatically suggests what documents you need
    - Templates pre-populate with your project information and update automatically
    - No more copying and pasting between documents - information flows automatically

2. Requirement Tracking (Better than Excel Spreadsheets)
    - Instead of manually tracking requirements in spreadsheets, the system automatically links everything
    - When you write a software requirement, it knows which tests need to verify it
    - If a requirement changes, it alerts you to all the documents that need updates
    - Real-time dashboards show compliance status instead of outdated spreadsheets

3. Interactive Guidance (Like Having an Expert Assistant)
    - Instead of guessing what EN 62304 or AAMI TIR45 requires, it guides you step-by-step
    - Interactive menus ask you questions and build your compliance package
    - Built-in knowledge of medical device regulations and what's required
    - Catches compliance issues before audits, not during them

Practical Example: Creating a Software Development Plan

Old Way (Word + Excel):

1. Find the right Word template (if it exists and is current)
2. Copy project info from other documents
3. Create Excel sheets to track requirements
4. Manually link documents together
5. Hope you didn't miss anything regulatory
6. Spend hours formatting and cross-referencing

PCL-QMS Way:

1. Choose "Create Software Development Plan" from the menu
2. System asks guided questions about your project
3. Automatically generates compliant document with:
    - Pre-filled project information
    - Required sections per EN 62304
    - Linked requirement tracking
    - Built-in compliance checks
4. Real-time validation ensures nothing is missed
5. Professional formatting and cross-references automatically maintained

Key Benefits You'll Notice

Consistency & Quality

- All documents follow the same professional standards
- No more inconsistent formatting or missing sections
- Built-in compliance knowledge ensures regulatory requirements are met

Time Savings

- Automated document generation saves hours of manual work
- Smart linking eliminates duplicate data entry
- Pre-built templates for all common medical device documents

Reduced Risk

- Built-in compliance checking catches issues early
- Automated requirement traceability prevents gaps
- Audit trail automatically maintained for regulatory inspections

Easy Navigation

- Intelligent menus guide you to what you need
- Search across all documents and requirements instantly
- Dashboard view of project status and compliance gaps

The Interface You'll Use

Instead of Windows Explorer and separate applications, you get:

- Interactive Command Line - Like a smart assistant that asks you questions
- Menu-Driven Interface - Clear choices for what you want to do
- Guided Workflows - Step-by-step processes for common tasks
- Real-Time Feedback - Immediate validation and suggestions

Think of it as having a regulatory expert and technical writer built into your computer that knows medical device standards and helps you create perfect documentation every time.

The best part? It builds on proven technology (TypeScript/Node.js) and integrates with modern development tools, so it's reliable and can grow with your needs.
