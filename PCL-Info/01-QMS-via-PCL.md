# Intelligent QMS Infrastructure for Medical Device Software Development

> *Written by Claude Code, edited by GTDD*

## Project Status Overview

### Current Progress Summary

This document presents the comprehensive design and implementation plan developed for transforming our existing development infrastructure into an intelligent QMS platform. The work completed addresses the core challenge of achieving regulatory compliance while maintaining modern AGILE development practices.

**Key Achievement**: A complete architectural solution that integrates regulatory requirements into natural development workflows, with detailed implementation roadmap and technical specifications ready for development kickoff.

## Problem Analysis Completed

### Current State Assessment

Through analysis of our existing QMS (SSI-SOP-10, SSI-SOP-20), regulatory requirements, and AGILE integration guides, I've identified the main challenges:

- **Traditional QMS**: Document-heavy Word/PDF system disconnected from development workflows
- **AGILE Integration Gap**: Current procedures aren't currently set up for iterative development practices
- **Manual Overhead**: Significant time spent on documentation and audit preparation
- **Traceability Issues**: Difficulty maintaining requirement-to-implementation links

### Solution Framework Developed  

The proposed system addresses these challenges by:

- **Workflow Integration**: Embedding compliance naturally into development processes
- **Automated Documentation**: Generating regulatory documentation from development artifacts
- **AGILE Compatibility**: Following AAMI TIR45 guidance for AGILE practices in medical device development
- **Modern Tooling**: Using Git, Markdown, and automated tools instead of manual document management

**Setup Time:**

- PCL-QMS (5) : Custom development with comprehensive implementation
- Docs-as-Code (3) : Low initial setup, high process setup - requires defining entire QMS structure from scratch
- Obsidian (3) : Moderate setup with plugin configuration and inevitable customization effort
- Formwork eQMS (5) : Minimal setup, cloud-based with out-of-the-box compliance
- Jira/Confluence (3) : Complex setup requiring dedicated administrator for compliant QMS workflows
- Traditional QMS (2) : Complex setup with extensive customization required

**AGILE Support:**

- PCL-QMS (5) : Built-in AAMI TIR45 support and native AGILE compliance validation
- Docs-as-Code (5) : Highly compatible with markdown-based user stories and bidirectional linking
- Obsidian (5) : Powerful plugin ecosystem (Kanban, Dataview) that enhances AGILE workflows beyond basic markdown
- Formwork eQMS (3) : Tools and capabilities for AGILE implementation but needs significant user effort and customization
- Jira/Confluence (4) : Strong project management features with AGILE methodologies
- Traditional QMS (1) : Poor AGILE integration

**Medical Focus:**

- PCL-QMS (5) : Purpose-built for EN 62304 and medical device workflows
- Docs-as-Code (1) : No inherent medical device knowledge - requires manual template creation
- Obsidian (1) : No inherent medical device knowledge - blank slate like Docs-as-Code
- Formwork eQMS (5) : ISO 13485/62304/14971/62366 compliant out-of-the-box
- Jira/Confluence (2) : Limited medical device compliance features
- Traditional QMS (4) : Proven compliance track records

**Audit Readiness:**

- PCL-QMS (5) : Built-in cryptographic audit trails and digital signatures
- Docs-as-Code (3) : Strong Git-based audit trail but requires explanation to auditors without extra scripting
- Obsidian (3) : Limited built-in audit capabilities, relies on Git history
- Formwork eQMS (5) : Comprehensive audit support with validated compliance reports
- Jira/Confluence (4) : Strong enterprise audit trail capabilities, well-understood in corporate environments
- Traditional QMS (4) : Comprehensive audit trails, proven regulatory acceptance (auditor familiarity v technical superiority)

**Customisation:**

- PCL-QMS (5) : Complete system customization with built-in compliance - easily adjustable via the live editor
- Docs-as-Code (5) : Infinite customization - greatest strength and weakness
- Obsidian (5) : Excellent document linking and flexible customization
- Formwork eQMS (3) : Vendor-defined workflows with limited customization
- Jira/Confluence (3) : Extensive plugin ecosystem but vendor-defined core
- Traditional QMS (1) : Limited customization, vendor-defined processes

**Accessibility:** (Intuitiveness, Onboarding, Troubleshooting)

- PCL-QMS (5) : Designed with guided workflows and a focused UI for medical device development roles (assumption)
- Docs-as-Code (2) : High for developers proficient in Git/CLI. Very low for non-technical roles (QA, Management), requiring significant training. Merge conflicts are a major hurdle.
- Obsidian (3) : More intuitive than CLI, but requires users to learn Markdown, plugin functionality (e.g., Dataview queries), and the specific QMS process built on top. The user is their own sysadmin.
- Formwork eQMS (5) : High. Purpose-built with prescriptive workflows, a clean UI, and vendor support for onboarding and troubleshooting. Designed for its target user.
- Jira/Confluence (3) : Mixed. The UI is powerful but notoriously complex and cluttered. Widespread familiarity helps, but onboarding often requires a dedicated admin and formal training.
- Traditional QMS (2) : The tools (Word, Excel) are intuitive, but the system is not. Lacks guardrails, making it opaque and highly prone to human error (e.g., version mix-ups, lost documents).

**Rating Scale Note**: `#####` represents "best" performance, `#` represents "worst" performance. Matrix ratings have been refined based on detailed analysis to better reflect realistic implementation complexity and capabilities.
