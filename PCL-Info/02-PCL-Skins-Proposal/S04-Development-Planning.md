# Development Planning for Refactor and Development of Skins System

> As of 05.08.2025

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. CLI Architecture Refactoring (Risk: 30% time overrun)
    - **Risk**: Complex interdependencies may require more extensive refactoring
    - **Mitigation**: Incremental approach, maintain backward compatibility during transition

2. Backward Compatibility (Risk: Integration complexity)
    - **Risk**: Existing functionality may break during refactoring
    - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive regression testing, staged rollout approach

3. Performance Impact (Risk: Plugin loading overhead)
    - **Risk**: Dynamic skin loading may impact CLI responsiveness
    - **Mitigation**: Caching strategies, performance benchmarking

### Medium-Risk Areas

1. Configuration Integration (Risk: Schema conflicts)
    - **Risk**: Skin configuration may conflict with existing template system
    - **Mitigation**: Careful schema design, extensive validation testing

2. Testing Infrastructure (Risk: Test complexity)
    - **Risk**: Testing dynamic skin behavior more complex than static testing
    - **Mitigation**: Invest in robust testing utilities early

## Strategic Recommendations

### Development Approach: **Evolutionary Architecture**

#### **Phase 1: Foundation Strengthening**

1. **Resolve Current Issues**: Fix Phase 2 integration test failures
2. **Strengthen CLI Foundation**: Extract reusable patterns from current CLI code
3. **Design Plugin Interfaces**: Create comprehensive skin system architecture

#### **Phase 2: Core Refactoring**  

1. **Implement Command Registry**: Begin with basic dynamic command registration
2. **Refactor Menu System**: Gradually migrate to data-driven menu generation
3. **Build Plugin Loading**: Create robust skin discovery and validation system

#### **Phase 3: Classic Skin Implementation**

1. **Extract Current Functionality**: Convert existing CLI to skin format (parallel with Phase 2)
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure full feature parity with current implementation
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize skin loading and command execution

#### **Phase 4: Integration & Polish**

1. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete system testing with multiple skin scenarios
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive skin development and usage documentation
3. **Performance Validation**: Ensure skin system meets performance requirements

### Progress: Success Metrics

#### **Technical Metrics**

- **Plugin Loading Time**: < 500ms for typical skins (target from analysis)
- **Memory Overhead**: < 50MB additional for loaded skins
- **Command Resolution**: < 10ms for dynamic command lookup  
- **Test Coverage**: > 90% for plugin system and core skins

#### **Functional Metrics**

- **Feature Parity**: 100% of current CLI functionality available in Classic skin
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing workflows continue without modification
- **User Experience**: Skin switching < 2 seconds, clear context indicators

### Key Success Factors

1. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: 50% of required functionality already exists
2. **Evolutionary Approach**: Minimize risk through incremental refactoring
3. **Maintain Quality Standards**: Preserve existing high-quality foundation
4. **Focus on User Experience**: Ensure skin system enhances rather than complicates usage
