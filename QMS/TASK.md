I have duplicated a repo for developing a CLI project, which you can see from the contents and your context, and copied into it a folder VDL2. My aim is to reuse the development components from the original repo (task breakdown, task following, templates, standards etc) for this new repo. This repo will focus entirely on the non-code based tasks that are roughly laid out in 'VDL2\QMS\Info.md' but capable of performing any future tasks that will arise during the documentation, analsysing, architectural design, etc of the QMS and related artifacts. Your task is to

1) meticulously analyse the contents of the VDL2 folder (turning pdfs in md files if needed - some have md counterparts, but you might be able to read the pdfs anyway)
2) determine what will be needed during the tasks that will spawn from it, work out what infrastructure (documents, layout, tools etc) would be ideal for those tasks
3) see what there is in this copied repo (everything other than the VDL2 folder contents) that would assist in carrying out these tasks
4) this will reveal what is lacking from the currently available resources, take note of the gaps and which resources would be ideal to fill them
5) work out how to refactor the copied repo to match the new tasks and resources based on the information you have gathered
6) proceed with the refactoring

There are a number of files in the copied repo that will need to be completely reworked for this task, such as the CLAUDE.md file, the folders of the phoenix-code-lite development (useful files/file contents extracted but the folder itself isn't relevant), etc.
