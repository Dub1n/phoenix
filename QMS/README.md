# Intelligent QMS Infrastructure for Medical Device Software Development

## Project Status Overview

### Current Progress Summary

This document presents the comprehensive design and implementation plan developed for transforming our existing development infrastructure into an intelligent QMS platform. The work completed addresses the core challenge of achieving regulatory compliance while maintaining modern AGILE development practices.

**Key Achievement**: A complete architectural solution that integrates regulatory requirements into natural development workflows, with detailed implementation roadmap and technical specifications ready for development kickoff.

## Problem Analysis Completed

### Current State Assessment

Through comprehensive analysis of our existing QMS (SSI-SOP-10, SSI-SOP-20) and regulatory requirements, I've identified the core challenges:

- **Traditional QMS**: Document-heavy Word/PDF system disconnected from development workflows
- **AGILE Integration Gap**: Current procedures don't accommodate iterative development practices
- **Manual Overhead**: Significant time spent on documentation and audit preparation
- **Traceability Issues**: Difficulty maintaining requirement-to-implementation links

### Solution Framework Developed  

The proposed system addresses these challenges by:

- **Workflow Integration**: Embedding compliance naturally into development processes
- **Automated Documentation**: Generating regulatory documentation from development artifacts
- **AGILE Compatibility**: Following AAMI TIR45 guidance for AGILE practices in medical device development
- **Modern Tooling**: Using Git, Markdown, and automated tools instead of manual document management
