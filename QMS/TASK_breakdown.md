# Task: QMS Documentation Infrastructure Refactoring

## Executive Summary

Transform the existing Phoenix-Code-Lite development repository into a specialized QMS documentation and analysis infrastructure capable of supporting medical device software compliance tasks, document analysis, and regulatory workflow management.

## Context and Technical Rationale

### Task Scope & Boundaries

**Included:**

- Analysis of VDL2/QMS content (PDFs, documents, regulations)
- Refactoring of existing development components for QMS tasks
- Creation of new infrastructure for document processing and analysis
- Integration of existing task breakdown and following guides
- Removal of Phoenix-Code-Lite specific content not relevant to QMS

**Excluded:**

- Actual QMS content creation (that's a separate task)
- Medical device software development (focus is on documentation infrastructure)
- Regulatory compliance validation (infrastructure supports this, doesn't provide it)

### Technical Justification

The existing repository contains valuable development infrastructure (task breakdown guides, templates, workflow systems) that can be repurposed for QMS documentation tasks. The VDL2 folder contains medical device software QMS requirements that need systematic analysis and documentation infrastructure to support compliance workflows.

### Success Impact

This refactoring will provide a robust foundation for:

- Systematic analysis of medical device software regulations
- Document processing and conversion workflows
- QMS compliance tracking and validation
- Agile-compliant documentation management
- Regulatory requirement traceability

## Prerequisites & Environment Setup

### Required Prerequisites

- Access to VDL2 folder content (PDFs, documents)
- Understanding of medical device software regulations (IEC 62304, etc.)
- Knowledge of QMS documentation requirements
- Familiarity with Agile development practices in regulated environments

### Environment Validation
>
> ```bash
> # Verify VDL2 folder structure exists
> ls VDL2/QMS/Docs/
> 
> # Check for PDF processing capabilities
> which pdftotext || echo "PDF processing tools needed"
> 
> # Verify markdown processing tools
> which markdownlint || echo "Markdown linting tools needed"
> ```

### Expected Environment State

- VDL2 folder accessible with all QMS documents
- PDF processing tools available for document conversion
- Markdown processing and validation tools installed
- Git repository with proper branching strategy

## Implementation Roadmap

### Overview

1. **Analysis Phase**: Deep examination of VDL2 content and existing repository structure
2. **Infrastructure Assessment**: Identify reusable components and gaps
3. **Documentation System Design**: Create new infrastructure for QMS tasks
4. **Repository Refactoring**: Remove irrelevant content, restructure for QMS focus
5. **Integration & Testing**: Ensure all components work together for QMS workflows

### Step 1: Test-Driven Development Foundation

**Test Suite Name**: "QMS Infrastructure Core Functionality Tests"

**Test Implementation Strategy:**

```typescript
// Test QMS document processing capabilities
describe('QMS Document Processing', () => {
  test('should convert PDF documents to markdown', () => {
    // Test PDF to markdown conversion
  });
  
  test('should extract regulatory requirements from documents', () => {
    // Test requirement extraction
  });
  
  test('should create traceability matrices', () => {
    // Test traceability matrix generation
  });
});

// Test task breakdown system for QMS tasks
describe('QMS Task Breakdown System', () => {
  test('should generate QMS-specific task breakdowns', () => {
    // Test task breakdown generation for QMS tasks
  });
  
  test('should validate QMS task completion criteria', () => {
    // Test completion validation
  });
});

// Test document analysis capabilities
describe('QMS Document Analysis', () => {
  test('should analyze regulatory compliance gaps', () => {
    // Test gap analysis functionality
  });
  
  test('should generate compliance reports', () => {
    // Test report generation
  });
});
```

**Validation Criteria:**

- All tests pass and validate core QMS infrastructure functionality
- Tests cover document processing, analysis, and task management
- Edge cases for different document formats are handled
- Error conditions are properly tested

### Step 2: VDL2 Content Analysis & Infrastructure Requirements
