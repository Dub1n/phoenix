# QMS Infrastructure Refactoring - Feasibility Assessment

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis of the QMS refactoring plan and current system state, this refactoring is **FEASIBLE** but requires significant preparation and risk mitigation. The plan is well-structured and technically sound, but several critical gaps must be addressed before implementation can begin.

## Current System Assessment

### Phoenix-Code-Lite Status: ✅ FUNCTIONAL

- **Test Coverage**: 21/24 test suites passing (87.5% success rate)
- **Core Functionality**: CLI, configuration management, TDD workflow orchestration operational
- **Architecture**: Solid TypeScript foundation with proper dependency injection and modular design
- **Tooling**: Jest testing, ESLint, TypeScript compilation all functional

### Regulatory Document Availability: ✅ AVAILABLE

- **EN 62304**: `VDL2/QMS/Docs/EN 62304-2006+A1-2015 Medical device software.pdf` (2.4MB)
- **AAMI TIR45**: `VDL2/QMS/Docs/AAMI/AAMI TIR45-2023 Guidance on the use of AGILE practices in the development of medical device software.pdf` (2.5MB)
- **Additional Documents**: SSI procedures and development process documents available

## Critical Gaps Identified

### 1. External Dependencies Missing ❌

**Issue**: PDF processing tools not available in current environment

- `pdftotext` command not found
- `pdfinfo` command not found
- Cryptographic libraries for digital signatures not verified

**Impact**: Core document processing functionality cannot be implemented as planned
**Mitigation**: Need to install or provide alternative PDF processing solutions

### 2. Regulatory Knowledge Gap ⚠️

**Issue**: Limited understanding of specific EN 62304 and AAMI TIR45 requirements

- Need detailed analysis of regulatory standards
- Requirement extraction patterns not yet defined
- Compliance validation criteria unclear

**Impact**: QMS functionality may not meet actual regulatory requirements
**Mitigation**: Detailed regulatory analysis required before Phase 3

### 3. Performance Baseline Unknown ⚠️

**Issue**: No performance measurements for existing system

- Document processing performance expectations not validated
- Integration impact on existing functionality unclear
- Scalability requirements undefined

**Impact**: Risk of performance degradation during refactoring
**Mitigation**: Establish performance baselines in Phase 1

### 4. Integration Complexity Underestimated ⚠️

**Issue**: Plan assumes seamless integration with existing components

- Current architecture analysis incomplete
- Extension patterns not fully validated
- Backward compatibility guarantees need verification

**Impact**: Risk of breaking existing functionality during refactoring

## Conclusion

The QMS Infrastructure refactoring is **FEASIBLE** with proper preparation and risk mitigation. The current Phoenix-Code-Lite system provides a solid foundation, and the regulatory documents are available. However, several critical gaps must be addressed before implementation can begin:

1. **Install PDF processing tools** or provide alternative solutions
2. **Conduct detailed regulatory analysis** of EN 62304 and AAMI TIR45
3. **Establish performance baselines** for existing system
