# Sample Task: Example Implementation Plan

**Task**: Demonstrate the Plan & Review workflow

**Date**: 2025-01-28

**Status**: Template/Example

## Initial Plan

### Objectives

- Create a structured approach to task planning
- Establish clear communication between Claude and user
- Document implementation steps for future reference

### Approach

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Understand requirements
   - Identify potential challenges
   - Research existing patterns in codebase

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Break down into small, manageable steps
   - Focus on MVP approach
   - Regular user feedback checkpoints

3. **Review Phase**
   - Document changes made
   - Update plan with actual implementation details
   - Prepare handover documentation

## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Analysis

- **Planned**: Research existing code patterns
- **Actual**: [To be filled during implementation]
- **Changes**: [Document any deviations from plan]

### Step 2: Implementation

- **Planned**: Write code following established patterns
- **Actual**: [To be filled during implementation]
- **Changes**: [Document any deviations from plan]

### Step 3: Testing

- **Planned**: Run appropriate test suite
- **Actual**: [To be filled during implementation]
- **Changes**: [Document any deviations from plan]

## User Feedback Checkpoints

### Initial Plan Review

- **User Response**: [User feedback on the plan before starting]
- **Adjustments Made**: [Any changes made based on feedback]

### Mid-Implementation Check

- **User Response**: [User feedback during implementation if needed]
- **Adjustments Made**: [Any changes made based on feedback]

## Final Documentation

### Changes Made

[Detailed list of all changes made during implementation]

### Files Modified

- `file1.js`: Description of changes
- `file2.ts`: Description of changes

### Testing Results

- Test suite run: [Pass/Fail]
- Manual testing: [Results]

### Handover Notes

[Any important information for future work or other engineers]
