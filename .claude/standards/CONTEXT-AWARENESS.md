# Context Awareness for VDL_Vault Repository Development

## ⊕ Understanding User Context Across Projects

Every change in the VDL_Vault repository must consider **where the user is in their workflow**, **what project they're working with**, and **what they're trying to achieve**. This document provides the context framework for making user-centric development decisions across all repository projects.

## ⇔ User Workflow Stages by Project Type

### * Phoenix Code Lite User Workflows

## ◊ Context-Sensitive Development Patterns

### Phoenix Code Lite Development
When working on PCL components, consider:

#### CLI Interaction Context
- **User State**: May be in middle of multi-step workflow
- **Session Context**: Preserve navigation and progress
- **Error Recovery**: Allow graceful recovery without losing progress
- **Performance**: Responsive interaction within 200ms

```typescript
// Consider session context in all CLI operations
class CLISession {
  private preserveUserContext(operation: () => Promise<void>): Promise<void> {
    // Save current state
    const currentContext = this.getUserContext();
    
    try {
      await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      // Restore context on error
      this.restoreUserContext(currentContext);
      // Provide recovery options
      this.offerRecoveryOptions(error);
    }
  }
}
```

#### TDD Workflow Context
- **Development Flow**: User is in active TDD cycle
- **Quality Focus**: Emphasize quality gates and testing
- **Iteration Support**: Support multiple TDD cycles
- **Progress Tracking**: Show clear progress through phases

### QMS Infrastructure Development
When working on QMS components, consider:

#### Compliance Context
- **Regulatory Focus**: All actions must maintain compliance
- **Audit Requirements**: Comprehensive logging and traceability
- **Validation Needs**: Thorough validation of all compliance aspects
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation for regulatory purposes

```typescript
// All QMS operations require comprehensive audit trails
class ComplianceValidator {
  async validateCompliance(context: ComplianceContext): Promise<ComplianceResult> {
    // Log start of compliance validation
    await this.auditLogger.logComplianceStart(context);
    
    try {
      const result = await this.performValidation(context);
      
      // Log detailed compliance results
      await this.auditLogger.logComplianceResult(result);
      
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      // Log compliance validation failure
      await this.auditLogger.logComplianceError(error, context);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Cross-Project Development
When working across multiple projects, consider:

#### Integration Context
- **Dependency Impact**: Changes may affect multiple projects
- **Consistency Requirements**: Maintain patterns across projects
- **Migration Needs**: Provide migration paths for breaking changes
- **Documentation**: Update all affected project documentation

## ◦ Context-Aware Implementation Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern
Reveal complexity gradually based on user expertise:

```typescript
// Basic interface for beginners
interface BasicConfig {
  projectPath: string;
  template: 'starter' | 'enterprise';
}

// Advanced interface for power users
interface AdvancedConfig extends BasicConfig {
  qualityThresholds: QualityThresholds;
  customValidators: CustomValidator[];
  auditSettings: AuditSettings;
}
```

### Context Preservation Pattern
Maintain user context across operations:

```typescript
interface UserContext {
  currentLocation: string;
  previousActions: Action[];
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  sessionState: SessionState;
}

class ContextManager {
  private context: UserContext;
  
  async executeWithContext<T>(
    operation: (context: UserContext) => Promise<T>
  ): Promise<T> {
    const snapshot = this.createContextSnapshot();
    
    try {
      return await operation(this.context);
    } catch (error) {
      this.restoreContext(snapshot);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Adaptive Guidance Pattern
Provide guidance based on user experience level:

```typescript
class AdaptiveGuidance {
  provideGuidance(user: UserProfile, task: Task): Guidance {
    if (user.experienceLevel === 'beginner') {
      return this.createDetailedGuidance(task);
    } else if (user.experienceLevel === 'intermediate') {
      return this.createSummaryGuidance(task);
    } else {
      return this.createMinimalGuidance(task);
    }
  }
}
```

## ⋇ Context Documentation Requirements

### User-Centric Documentation
For all development work, document:

1. **User Impact**: How changes affect user workflows
2. **Context Preservation**: How user context is maintained
3. **Error Recovery**: How users can recover from errors
4. **Performance**: How changes affect user experience responsiveness

### Context Testing Requirements
Test all changes with realistic user contexts:

```typescript
describe('Context-Aware Feature', () => {
  it('should preserve user context during operation', async () => {
    const initialContext = createUserContext();
    const feature = new ContextAwareFeature();
    
    await feature.executeOperation(initialContext);
    
    expect(feature.getUserContext()).toMatchObject(initialContext);
  });
  
  it('should provide appropriate guidance based on user experience', () => {
    const beginnerUser = createBeginnerUser();
    const expertUser = createExpertUser();
    
    const beginnerGuidance = feature.getGuidance(beginnerUser);
    const expertGuidance = feature.getGuidance(expertUser);
    
    expect(beginnerGuidance.detail).toBeGreaterThan(expertGuidance.detail);
  });
});
```

---

**Context awareness ensures**:
- **User-Centric Design**: All changes consider user impact and workflow
- **Experience Continuity**: Users maintain context across operations
- **Appropriate Guidance**: Users receive guidance matched to their experience level
- **Error Recovery**: Users can recover gracefully from errors
- **Project Alignment**: Changes align with project-specific user needs and workflows
