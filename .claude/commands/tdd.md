You are initiating a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) cycle for the following feature: "$ARGUMENTS".

Follow these steps precisely:

1. First, write the complete set of failing tests required to validate this feature. Do not write any implementation code at this stage. Ensure the tests cover primary use cases and edge cases.

2. After writing the tests, run them and confirm that they fail as expected.

3. Once the failing tests are in place, ask for my confirmation to proceed.

4. After I confirm, write the minimal implementation code necessary to make all tests pass. Do not modify the test files during this step.

5. Continuously run the tests against your implementation until all of them pass.

6. Finally, present the completed implementation code.
