# Haruspex 1.0 — Enhanced Architecture and Integration Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates the exploratory analysis into a cohesive plan for evolving Haruspex as a **scripted documentation automator and project manager** that creates a comprehensive "map" or "view" of codebases. Building upon existing YAML frontmatter infrastructure and NoDeRR architecture systems, Haruspex will automate DSS-informed documentation patterns while maintaining its core ethos as a documentation and analysis tool rather than a development automator.

## Objective and Scope

- **Objective**: Enhance Haruspex to automate documentation and project management workflows using proven DSS concepts while preserving existing metadata infrastructure and maintaining focus on codebase mapping and analysis.
- **Scope**: Three-phase architecture (Exposition/Augury/Observance), integration with existing systems, user-controlled templates and workflows, transparent automation processes, and comprehensive data portability. This is a design/strategy document defining implementable architecture.
- **Core Principle**: Haruspex remains primarily a documentation automator that creates navigable codebase "maps" rather than becoming a development automation system.

## Assessment of Existing Infrastructure

### Current YAML Frontmatter System

Haruspex already operates within an ecosystem with mature metadata infrastructure:

**Existing NoDeRR Audit System** (`scripts/noderr-audit/index.cjs`):

- Handles `tags`, `provides`, `requires` fields across multiple formats
- Supports JSON stub format, comment-based stubs, and frontmatter extraction
- Provides automated stub injection and validation capabilities
- Maintains field richness with title, description, and relationship mapping

**Integration Approach**: Rather than replacing existing systems, Haruspex will enhance and orchestrate the current metadata infrastructure, adding intelligence and automation while preserving established patterns.

## Rationale for Enhanced DSS Alignment

Building upon existing infrastructure, DSS offers proven patterns for automated documentation excellence:

- **Enhanced Metadata Orchestration**: Leverage existing `tags`, `provides`, `requires` infrastructure with intelligent content generation and relationship mapping
- **Three-Phase Documentation Pipeline**: Exposition → Augury → Observance (replacing generic discovery/classification/planning phases with thematically appropriate documentation-focused phases)
- **User-Controlled Templates**: Template-first creation with comprehensive user control, modification, and portability
- **Transparent Task Orchestration**: Clear visibility into all automated processes with hierarchical task decomposition
- **Automated Maintenance**: Build upon existing validation with enhanced cross-reference management and metadata integrity

These patterns align with Haruspex's enhanced goal: **automated documentation excellence** that creates navigable, intelligent codebase maps.
