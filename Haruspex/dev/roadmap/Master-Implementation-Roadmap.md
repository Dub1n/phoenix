# Haruspex VSCode Extension - Master Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Haruspex is a fully embedded VSCode extension that provides intelligent documentation management with real-time visualization, interactive Mermaid diagrams, truth matrix health monitoring, and TDD workflow kanban boards. This roadmap transforms the comprehensive design document into a systematic 8-phase development plan that leverages proven Phoenix Code Lite components while implementing new embedded architecture specifically designed for VSCode extension deployment.

## Context and Technical Rationale

### Task Scope & Boundaries

**Included in This Implementation:**
- Complete VSCode extension with embedded architecture (no external servers)
- Integration of proven Phoenix Code Lite components (TDD Orchestrator, Session Manager, Menu System, Project Discovery)
- New Haruspex-specific components (Truth Matrix Calculator, Code Stub Parser, Mermaid Generator, File Monitor)
- Four primary UI providers (Documentation Tree, Mermaid WebView, Kanban WebView, Truth Matrix Dashboard)
- Real-time file monitoring and automatic updates using VSCode APIs
- One-click marketplace installation with zero setup required for basic features
- Professional VSCode extension packaging and distribution

**Excluded from This Implementation:**
- NodeRR system dependencies (explicitly eliminated per design document)
- External server architecture or REST API endpoints
- Standalone CLI tools (optional future enhancement)
- Advanced enterprise features (multi-developer coordination, advanced analytics)

### Technical Justification

**Architecture Decision: Fully Embedded Extension**

Based on the design document's critical analysis, this approach provides:

1. **10x Performance Improvement**: Direct in-process calls vs. REST API overhead
2. **100% Reliability**: No external dependencies to fail or require complex setup
3. **True One-Click Install**: Standard VSCode marketplace experience
4. **Simplified Maintenance**: Single codebase vs. coordinated multi-component system

**Component Reuse Strategy**

Leveraging proven Phoenix Code Lite components reduces development risk and accelerates delivery:

- **Project Discovery**: Existing file system scanning and project analysis (✓ Proven)
- **Session Manager**: Validated session state and context management (✓ Proven)  
- **Menu System**: Navigation and content organization patterns (✓ Proven)
- **TDD Orchestrator**: Workflow management and quality gates (✓ Proven)

**New Components Justification**

New Haruspex components address VSCode-specific requirements:

- **Truth Matrix Calculator**: Real coverage metrics vs. NodeRR's false positives
- **Code Stub Parser**: Multi-format stub extraction for documentation discovery
- **Mermaid Generator**: Programmatic diagram generation and real-time updates
- **File Monitor**: VSCode API integration for embedded real-time updates

### Success Impact

**Market Positioning**: First-in-category VSCode extension providing comprehensive documentation visualization with embedded architecture excellence
