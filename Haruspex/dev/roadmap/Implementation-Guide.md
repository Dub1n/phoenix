# Haruspex Implementation Guide - Systematic Development Execution

## Purpose

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for executing the Haruspex VSCode extension development using the structured roadmap system. It ensures systematic, quality-first implementation that follows proven Phoenix Code Lite patterns while delivering innovative embedded architecture.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites Validation

Before beginning implementation, validate your development environment:

```bash
# Verify core development environment
node --version  # Should be v18.0+
npm --version   # Should be v8.0+
code --version  # VSCode should be 1.74+

# Install VSCode extension development tools
npm install -g yo generator-code vsce

# Verify extension development capability
yo code  # Should launch extension generator successfully
```

### 2. Repository Setup

```bash
# Create development workspace
mkdir haruspex-vscode
cd haruspex-vscode

# Initialize git repository
git init
git remote add origin [your-repository-url]

# Create initial branch structure
git checkout -b main
git checkout -b development
git checkout -b phase-01-foundation
```

### 3. Roadmap Navigation

The roadmap system consists of four core documents:

1. **Master-Implementation-Roadmap.md** - High-level overview and phase breakdown
2. **Phase-Template-Generator.md** - Template for creating detailed phase documents
3. **Phase-Dependency-Framework.md** - Dependencies and validation framework
4. **Implementation-Guide.md** - This document with execution instructions

## Phase Development Process

### Phase Generation Workflow

For each phase, follow this systematic approach:

#### Step 1: Generate Phase Document

```bash
# Create phase-specific directory
mkdir -p phases/phase-[N]-[name]
cd phases/phase-[N]-[name]

# Copy and customize phase template
cp ../../Phase-Template-Generator.md Phase-[N]-[Name]-Implementation.md

# Customize template with phase-specific content from Master Roadmap
# Replace all template placeholders with actual requirements
# Add technical specifications and implementation details
```

#### Step 2: Validate Phase Prerequisites

```bash
# Check dependency framework for phase entry criteria
# Review Phase-Dependency-Framework.md for specific requirements

# Validate previous phase completion
./scripts/validate-phase-entry.sh [phase-number]  # Create this script based on framework

# Confirm development environment ready for phase
npm test  # Previous phase tests should pass
npm run lint  # Code quality should be maintained
```

#### Step 3: Execute Phase Implementation

Follow the TDD-first approach defined in each phase document:

1. **Implement Tests First** (Red Phase)
   ```bash
   # Create test files before implementation
   # Run tests to confirm they fail appropriately
   npm test  # Should show failing tests for new functionality
   ```

2. **Implement Minimal Code** (Green Phase)
   ```bash
   # Write minimal code to pass tests
   # Focus on functionality, not optimization
   npm test  # Should show passing tests
   ```

3. **Refactor and Optimize** (Blue Phase)
   ```bash
   # Improve code quality while maintaining tests
   # Add error handling and edge case support
   npm run lint  # Should maintain code quality standards
   ```

#### Step 4: Validate Phase Completion

```bash
# Run comprehensive phase validation
npm run build    # TypeScript compilation should succeed
npm test         # All tests should pass
npm run lint     # Code quality should meet standards

# Validate phase-specific exit criteria
# Check Phase-Dependency-Framework.md for specific validation requirements

# Commit phase completion
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Phase [N]: [Name] - All exit criteria met"
git push origin phase-[N]-[name]
```
