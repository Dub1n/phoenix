### Critical Path Analysis

**Primary Critical Path**: P1 → P2 → P3 → P5 → P6 → P7 → P8 (36-44 days)
**Secondary Path**: P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P6 → P7 → P8 (34-42 days)
**Parallel Opportunity**: P4 and P5 can execute in parallel after P3 completion

**Bottleneck Identification**:
- **Phase 2** (Core Engine): Highest technical complexity, blocks all subsequent phases
- **Phase 5** (WebView Providers): Complex UI implementation, high integration requirements
- **Phase 6** (File Monitoring): Integration point for all UI components

## Risk Mitigation Framework

### High-Risk Dependencies

**Phase 2 → Phase 3 Integration Risk**
- **Risk**: Core engine API changes during PCL integration
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive API documentation and interface contracts
- **Contingency**: Adapter pattern implementation to isolate integration changes

**Phase 3 → Phases 4&5 Parallel Risk**
- **Risk**: Core functionality changes affecting both UI implementations
- **Mitigation**: Strict API versioning and integration testing
- **Contingency**: Sequential development fallback if parallel integration fails

**Phase 5 → Phase 6 Performance Risk**
- **Risk**: WebView providers create performance bottlenecks for file monitoring
- **Mitigation**: Performance benchmarking and optimization throughout Phase 5
- **Contingency**: WebView optimization or functionality reduction if performance targets not met

### Dependency Validation Framework

**Phase Entry Validation Checklist:**
```bash
# Automated validation script for each phase
./scripts/validate-phase-entry.sh [phase-number]

# Example Phase 3 validation
./scripts/validate-phase-entry.sh 3
# Validates:
# - Phase 2 exit criteria met
# - Core engine API functional
# - Test suite passing
# - Performance benchmarks achieved
```

**Cross-Phase Integration Testing:**
- Integration test suite runs across phase boundaries
- API compatibility validation between phases
- Performance regression testing at each phase transition
- User experience consistency validation

### Quality Assurance Checkpoints

**Weekly Progress Validation:**
- Phase progress against timeline and deliverables
- Quality gate completion and validation
- Risk assessment and mitigation effectiveness
- Dependency satisfaction and blocker identification

**Phase Transition Reviews:**
- Complete exit criteria validation
