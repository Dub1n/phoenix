### Types of Competitive Moats for PCL

In business strategy, a "moat" refers to a sustainable competitive advantage that protects a company from competitors - like a castle's moat keeps out invaders. In the context of PCL and its skins system, these moats are the unique, hard-to-replicate strengths that make the platform defensible and valuable over time.

1. **Technical Moats**: Deep integrations (e.g., AI agents, quality gates, audit systems) that are difficult for competitors to match.
2. **User Experience Moats**: Features like a visual skin builder and progressive complexity that make the platform uniquely approachable and powerful.
3. **Network Moats**: A growing ecosystem - skin marketplace, community contributions, and a template library - that increases value as more people participate.
4. **Data Moats**: Proprietary insights from cross-industry workflows and agent performance, which improve the platform and are hard for others to duplicate.

### Market Size Expansion

**Current Market**: Claude Code developers (~thousands)
**With Skins Market**: Enterprise workflows across regulated industries (~millions)

The skins system would transform PCL from a development tool into a **workflow orchestration platform**, dramatically expanding addressable market and strategic value.
