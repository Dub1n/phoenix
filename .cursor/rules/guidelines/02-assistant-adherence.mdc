# Assistant Guideline Adherence Commitment

## Structured Internal Process

To ensure consistent adherence to DSS operating instructions and guidelines, I commit to the following structured internal checklist for each user prompt:

### Core Process Steps

1. **Understand Prompt**: Fully comprehend the user's request or instruction
2. **Gather Context**: Access and process relevant information from:
   - Current file and attached files
   - Project structure ([INDEX.md](mdc:INDEX.md))
   - Conversation history
   - DSS rules and guidelines

3. **Identify Applicable Guidelines**: Determine which instructions are pertinent:
   - Core DSS rules ([00-dss-core.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/00-dss-core.mdc), [01-dss-behavior.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/01-dss-behavior.mdc))
   - Relevant workflows from workflows/ directory
   - Specific guidelines from guidelines/ directory
   - Configuration from config/ directory

4. **Plan & Cross-Reference**: Develop a plan that explicitly references:
   - Necessary workflow steps (quick tasks, code modification, etc.)
   - Maintenance tasks (updating TODOs, roadmap, frontmatter, links)
   - Template usage from available templates
   - Validation requirements

5. **Execute & Integrate**: Perform planned actions ensuring:
   - Documentation updates are integrated into execution flow
   - Maintenance tasks are completed as part of the work
   - DSS conventions are followed throughout

6. **Review & Verify**: Check outcomes against:
   - Prompt requirements
   - Applicable guidelines  
   - DSS standards and conventions

7. **Respond**: Formulate clear and comprehensive response to user

### Contextual Guideline Activation

I will actively recognize conversational triggers that indicate relevance of specific guidelines:

- **Assistant capabilities/improvements** → Consult [development queue](mdc:.cursor/rules/workflows/07-development-queue.mdc) and guidelines
- **Documentation structure/indexing** → Apply [folder README policy](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/07-folder-readme-policy.mdc) and [backlink conventions](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/06-backlink-conventions.mdc)  
- **Task tracking/project status** → Use [task decomposition](mdc:.cursor/rules/workflows/04-task-decomposition.mdc) and project management guidelines
- **File naming/organization** → Apply [naming conventions](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/03-naming-conventions.mdc) and [validation rules](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/04-validation-rules.mdc)
- **GitHub Issues** → Use [issue label conventions](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/08-github-issue-labels.mdc) and [development queue workflows](mdc:.cursor/rules/workflows/07-development-queue.mdc)

### Proactive Guideline Check

Before generating responses or executing tool calls, I will:
- Perform explicit internal check for all relevant DSS instructions
- Identify applicable guidelines from the full rules structure
- Ensure integrated documentation maintenance is planned

### Documentation Maintenance Priority

I will treat updates to relevant documentation as integral parts of fulfilling requests:
- Update [INDEX.md](mdc:INDEX.md) for structural changes
- Maintain frontmatter following [validation rules](mdc:.cursor/rules/guidelines/04-validation-rules.mdc)
- Apply naming conventions consistently
- Update cross-references and backlinks
- Follow tag conventions

### Handling Ambiguity

In cases of uncertainty:
- Seek clarification from user or consult other DSS documentation
- Propose updates to rules if conflicts are identified
- Prioritize core DSS documentation integrity

### Core Documentation Priority

Internal prioritization for maintaining accuracy and integrity of:
- [INDEX.md](mdc:INDEX.md) - Project navigation and structure
- Workflow files - Process consistency
- Guidelines - Convention adherence  
- Core rules - Fundamental DSS principles
