# DSS Rule Configuration Optimization Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the optimal configuration strategy for DSS Cursor rules, balancing comprehensive coverage with context efficiency through a selective hybrid approach.

## Current vs. Recommended Configuration

### Current Setup Analysis

- **Total Rules**: 22 files (2 core + 8 workflows + 11 guidelines + 1 config)
- **Current Configuration**: All rules set to "Always" (alwaysApply: true)
- **Context Impact**: ~22 rules loaded in every conversation
- **Token Usage**: High baseline context consumption

### Recommended Hybrid Approach

#### Always (Essential Foundation - 4 files)

Keep these core rules always loaded for consistent DSS operation:

- `00-dss-core.mdc` - Core DSS concepts needed for all decisions
- `01-dss-behavior.mdc` - Riley personality and consistent behavior
- `workflows/00-workflow-selection.mdc` - Decision tree essential for all tasks
- `guidelines/01-dss-maintenance.mdc` - Maintenance integration for all workflows

#### Agent Requested (Context-Specific - 17 files)

Convert these rules to agent-requested with optimized descriptions:

- 7 individual workflow files
- 10 specific guideline files

#### Why Not Auto-Attached?

DSS is methodology-agnostic and works with any project type. DSS workflows are driven by task type and complexity, not file extensions, making file-pattern-based triggers ineffective.

## Optimal Agent Requested Descriptions

```mdc
description: "USE WHEN managing continuous improvement cycles, processing installation reports, or generating development tasks from user feedback patterns. Provides automated task generation and community-driven enhancement workflows."
```

### Guidelines Files

#### `guidelines/00-dss-templates.mdc`

```mdc
description: "USE WHEN creating new files or working with code/documentation templates. Provides template selection guidance, frontmatter standards, and file creation patterns for consistent project structure."
```

```

```mdc
description: "USE WHEN naming files, functions, variables, or organizing project structure. Provides LLM-optimized naming standards, semantic discoverability patterns, and file organization conventions."
```

#### `guidelines/04-validation-rules.mdc`

```mdc
description: "USE WHEN working with YAML frontmatter, file metadata, validation errors, or auto-correction. Provides frontmatter standards, format consistency rules, and validation integration protocols."
```

#### `guidelines/05-tag-conventions.mdc`

```mdc
description: "USE WHEN adding tags to files, categorizing content, or organizing metadata classification systems. Provides comprehensive tagging standards, classification guidelines, and tag consistency frameworks."
```

#### `guidelines/06-backlink-conventions.mdc`

```mdc
description: "USE WHEN managing cross-references, updating documentation links, handling file renames, or maintaining bidirectional navigation. Provides backlink implementation and reference tracking standards."
```

#### `guidelines/07-folder-readme-policy.mdc`

```mdc

```

#### `guidelines/08-github-issue-labels.mdc`

```mdc
description: "USE WHEN working with GitHub Issues, applying labels, or managing project issue classification systems. Provides standardized label conventions, categorization systems, and automated labeling guidance."
```

```mdc
description: "USE WHEN collecting user feedback, implementing continuous improvement, analyzing performance patterns, or enhancing development processes. Provides feedback collection, integration protocols, and improvement implementation frameworks."
```

## Description Design Principles

### Effective Trigger Patterns

- **Clear Activation**: Start with "USE WHEN" followed by specific scenarios
- **Multiple Contexts**: Include various related situations that might trigger the rule
- **Action-Oriented**: Focus on what the user is trying to accomplish
- **Semantic Richness**: Use terms the agent might encounter in user requests

### Capability Communication

- **Specific Provides**: Clearly state what the rule delivers
- **Differentiation**: Distinguish between similar rules (e.g., workflow types)
- **Scope Clarity**: Define boundaries and applicability

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Workflow Conversion

1. Convert individual workflow files to Agent Requested
2. Test workflow selection and transitions
3. Verify agent requests appropriate workflows when following MDC links

### Phase 2: Guidelines Conversion

1. Start with less frequently used guidelines
2. Convert high-impact guidelines (templates, validation, naming)
3. Monitor effectiveness and adjust descriptions

### Phase 3: Validation and Optimization

1. Track rule request patterns
2. Refine descriptions based on usage
3. Optimize for common scenarios

## Benefits of Hybrid Approach

### Performance Improvements

- **Token Efficiency**: Reduces base context by ~75%
- **Faster Response**: Less context processing overhead
- **Targeted Loading**: Only relevant rules loaded per conversation

### Maintains DSS Integrity

- **Core Always Available**: Essential DSS concepts never missing
- **Smart Context**: Agent intelligently requests specific guidance
- **Self-Healing**: Proper descriptions enable automatic rule discovery
- **Cross-Reference Support**: MDC links provide navigation paths

### Operational Benefits

- **Intentional Context**: Agent becomes more deliberate about rule usage
- **Reduced Noise**: Less irrelevant context in conversations
- **Scalable**: System can grow without linear context increase

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics

- Rule request frequency by type
- Workflow transition accuracy
- Agent decision quality with reduced context
- User satisfaction with response relevance

### Adjustment Triggers

- Rules never being requested (description too narrow)
- Rules over-requested (description too broad)
- Missing context in specific scenarios
- User feedback on response quality

## Rollback Strategy

If the hybrid approach proves problematic:

1. **Immediate**: Revert critical rules to Always
2. **Selective**: Keep high-value rules as Agent Requested
3. **Analysis**: Determine optimal always/requested balance
4. **Refinement**: Improve descriptions based on learnings

## Best Practices

### Rule Description Maintenance

- Regular review of trigger scenarios
- Update based on actual usage patterns
- Incorporate user feedback on missing context
- Test descriptions with real scenarios

### System Evolution

- Monitor Cursor rule system updates
- Adapt to new rule types and capabilities
- Maintain compatibility with DSS principles
- Document changes and rationale

This optimization strategy maintains DSS's comprehensive guidance while significantly improving context efficiency and response quality.
