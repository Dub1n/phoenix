# [Integration Name] Integration

## Problem Statement

[Describe the specific problem or friction point this integration addresses. Include:]

1. **Issue 1**: Brief description of the first problem
2. **Issue 2**: Brief description of the second problem
3. **Issue 3**: Brief description of the third problem
4. **Tool compatibility**: How current DSS format affects compatibility with specific tools

## Why This Should Be Solved

[Explain the justification and benefits:]

1. **Primary benefit**: Main reason this should be prioritized
2. **Workflow efficiency**: How this improves development workflows
3. **Tool ecosystem**: Impact on broader tool integration
4. **User experience**: How this affects user productivity

## Desired Outcome

[Define success criteria. An ideal integration that:]

1. **Preserves existing functionality**: What current features must remain intact
2. **Enables new capability**: What new functionality should be added
3. **Maintains compatibility**: What compatibility requirements must be met
4. **Provides feedback**: What user feedback or visual indicators are needed
5. **Handles edge cases**: What error conditions should be gracefully handled

## Proposed Solution

### Architecture Overview

[Describe the high-level approach:]

Create a [type of integration] called "[Integration Name]" that:

1. **Core mechanism**: How the integration works at a high level
2. **Integration points**: Where it hooks into existing systems
3. **User interface**: How users interact with the integration
4. **Data handling**: How it processes or transforms data

### Core Implementation

[Include key code examples, configuration, or implementation details]

```[language]
// Example implementation code
// Key functions or configuration
```

### Enhanced Features

[List additional features beyond the core functionality:]

1. **Feature 1**: Description of enhanced capability
2. **Feature 2**: Description of another enhanced capability
3. **Feature 3**: Description of a third enhanced capability
4. **Settings/Configuration**: Customization options
5. **Integration commands**: Additional commands or actions
