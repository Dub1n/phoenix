# Phoenix Framework: AI-Driven Software Development System

## Executive Summary

The Phoenix Framework is a modular, self-correcting system for autonomous AI-driven software development. It transforms the software development lifecycle from requirement gathering to deployment-ready code through a collaboration of specialized AI agents orchestrated by a finite state machine (StateFlow).

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Autonomous Development**: End-to-end project generation with minimal human supervision
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized AI agents (Requirements Analyst, Test Engineer, Implementation, Security, etc.)
- **Self-Correction**: Built-in debugging and iterative improvement through Generative Test-Driven Development (GTDD)
- **Dual-Mode Operation**: Phoenix-Lite for rapid development, Full Phoenix for complex projects
- **Claude Code Integration**: Optimized workflows for Anthropic's Claude Code CLI

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Phoenix-Lite (Rapid Prototyping)

```bash
# 1. Set up your project brief
echo "Build a user authentication system with login/logout" > project_brief.md

# 2. Run Phoenix-Lite
phoenix-lite "Implement user authentication based on project_brief.md"
```

### Option 2: Full Phoenix Framework

```bash
# 1. Initialize Phoenix project
phoenix init my-web-app

# 2. Define requirements
phoenix requirements "E-commerce platform with user management, product catalog, and checkout"

# 3. Let Phoenix build it
phoenix generate --full
```

## Framework Architecture

Phoenix operates on three core principles:

1. **Modularity**: Distinct, specialized agents with clear responsibilities
2. **Scalability**: Handles projects of varying complexity through task decomposition  
3. **Automatability**: Machine-readable artifacts and structured communication protocols

### StateFlow Model

Phoenix manages development through a finite state machine with states including:

- **TRIAGE**: Route to Phoenix-Lite or Full workflow based on complexity
- **REQUIREMENT_INGESTION**: Generate structured Software Requirements Specification
- **DECOMPOSITION**: Break down into Work Breakdown Structure
- **GENERATION_CYCLE**: Execute Test-Driven Development loop
- **VERIFICATION_CYCLE**: Automated testing and security auditing
- **AGGREGATION**: Integrate components into final project

### Multi-Agent Team

- **Orchestrator Agent**: Project manager directing the StateFlow FSM
- **Requirements Analyst**: Transforms user requests into structured specifications
- **Test Engineer**: Generates comprehensive test suites before implementation
- **Implementation Agent**: Writes minimal code to pass tests
- **Security Analyst**: Audits code for vulnerabilities
- **Documentation Agent**: Generates comprehensive project documentation
