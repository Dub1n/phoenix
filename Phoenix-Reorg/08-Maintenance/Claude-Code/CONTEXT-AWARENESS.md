# Context Awareness for Phoenix Code Lite Development

## üéØ Understanding User Context

Every change to Phoenix Code Lite must consider **where the user is in their workflow** and **what they're trying to achieve**. This document provides the context framework for making user-centric development decisions.

## üîÑ User Workflow Stages

### 1. Project Setup & Initialization
**User Goal**: Get Phoenix Code Lite working in their project  
**Context**: First-time user or new project setup  
**Mental State**: Learning, potentially frustrated if setup is complex

#### User Journey:
```text
Install ‚Üí Initialize ‚Üí Configure ‚Üí First Use
```

#### Key Considerations:
- **Simplicity**: Setup should be one-command simple
- **Clear Feedback**: User should know if setup succeeded
- **Helpful Errors**: Failed setup should provide actionable guidance
- **Quick Win**: First successful workflow builds confidence

#### Code Impact Areas:
- CLI initialization commands (`phoenix-code-lite init`)
- Configuration wizard and template selection
- Error messages during setup
- Progress indicators and feedback

### 2. Configuration & Customization
**User Goal**: Optimize Phoenix Code Lite for their specific needs  
**Context**: User understands basics, wants to customize  
**Mental State**: Exploring, wanting control over behavior

#### User Journey:
```text
Default Config ‚Üí Explore Options ‚Üí Adjust Settings ‚Üí Test Changes
```

#### Key Considerations:
- **Discoverability**: Users should easily find configuration options
- **Safety**: Configuration changes shouldn't break the system
- **Reversibility**: Users should be able to undo changes
- **Validation**: Invalid configurations should be caught early

#### Code Impact Areas:
- Configuration system (`src/config/settings.ts`, `src/config/templates.ts`)
- CLI configuration commands
- Interactive configuration editor
- Configuration validation and error handling

### 3. Daily Development Workflow

- Audit logging (`src/utils/audit-logger.ts`)
- Metrics collection (`src/utils/metrics.ts`)
- Report generation (`src/cli/advanced-cli.ts`)

### 5. Troubleshooting & Problem Resolution
**User Goal**: Understand and fix issues when they occur  
**Context**: Something went wrong, user needs help  
**Mental State**: Frustrated, urgent need for resolution

#### User Journey:
```text
Error Occurrence ‚Üí Error Message ‚Üí Troubleshooting ‚Üí Resolution
```

#### Key Considerations:
- **Clear Errors**: Error messages should explain what went wrong
- **Actionable Guidance**: Users should know what to do next
- **Context Preservation**: Provide enough context for debugging
- **Recovery**: System should help user recover gracefully

#### Code Impact Areas:
- Error handling throughout the system
- Help system (`src/cli/help-system.ts`)
- Audit logging for troubleshooting
- Validation and security guardrails

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Context Layers

### 1. Application Layer Context
Understanding how Phoenix Code Lite fits into the user's development environment.

#### Integration Points:
- **Project Structure**: How Phoenix Code Lite interacts with existing projects
- **Development Tools**: Integration with IDEs, version control, CI/CD
- **Team Workflows**: How multiple developers use Phoenix Code Lite
- **Deployment Processes**: How generated code fits into deployment pipelines

#### Considerations for Development:
- **File System Respect**: Don't interfere with existing project structure
- **Tool Compatibility**: Work well with popular development tools
- **Team Coordination**: Support collaborative development practices
- **Version Control**: Generate code that works well with Git workflows

### 2. System Integration Context
How Phoenix Code Lite interacts with the broader system environment.

#### System Boundaries:
- **Claude Code SDK**: Primary LLM integration point
- **Node.js Ecosystem**: NPM packages, TypeScript tooling
- **File System**: Reading/writing project files safely
- **Operating System**: Cross-platform compatibility considerations

#### Considerations for Development:
- **Resource Management**: Efficient use of system resources
- **Security Boundaries**: Respect security constraints
- **Error Propagation**: Handle system-level errors gracefully
- **Performance Impact**: Minimize impact on system performance

### 3. Data Flow Context
Understanding how data moves through Phoenix Code Lite and its lifecycle.

#### Data Journey:
```text
User Input ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí LLM Interaction ‚Üí 
Output Generation ‚Üí Quality Validation ‚Üí File System ‚Üí User Review
```

#### Data Types and Contexts:
- **User Input**: Task descriptions, configuration preferences
- **Configuration Data**: Templates, settings, user preferences
- **Workflow Data**: Phase results, quality metrics, audit logs
- **Generated Code**: Files, tests, documentation
- **System State**: Progress, errors, performance metrics

#### Considerations for Development:
- **Data Validation**: Validate all data at system boundaries
- **State Management**: Maintain consistent state throughout workflows
- **Error Recovery**: Handle data corruption or invalid states
- **Privacy**: Protect sensitive user data and configuration

## üé® User Experience Context

### 1. CLI User Experience Patterns
Understanding how users interact with command-line interfaces.

#### CLI UX Principles:
- **Predictability**: Commands should behave consistently
- **Discoverability**: Help should be easily accessible
- **Efficiency**: Power users should have shortcuts
- **Forgiveness**: Easy to undo or correct mistakes

#### Phoenix Code Lite CLI Patterns:
```bash
# Progressive disclosure - simple to complex
phoenix-code-lite generate --task "basic task"
phoenix-code-lite generate --task "complex task" --framework react --verbose

# Contextual help
phoenix-code-lite help
phoenix-code-lite help generate
phoenix-code-lite generate --help

# Configuration hierarchy
phoenix-code-lite config --show
phoenix-code-lite config --template enterprise
phoenix-code-lite config --edit
```

### 2. Progress and Feedback Patterns
Users need to understand what's happening during long-running operations.

#### Feedback Requirements:
- **Immediate Acknowledgment**: Confirm command was received
- **Progress Indication**: Show what's currently happening
- **Time Estimation**: When possible, indicate expected completion
- **Success/Failure Clarity**: Clear indication of outcomes

#### Implementation Patterns:
```typescript
// Progress tracking example
const tracker = new ProgressTracker(['Plan & Test', 'Implement & Fix', 'Refactor & Document']);
tracker.startPhase('Plan & Test');
// ... work happens
tracker.completePhase(true);
tracker.startPhase('Implement & Fix');
```

### 3. Error Recovery Patterns
When things go wrong, users need clear paths to resolution.

#### Error Recovery Hierarchy:
1. **Prevention**: Validate inputs to prevent errors
2. **Graceful Handling**: When errors occur, handle them gracefully
3. **Clear Communication**: Explain what went wrong and why
4. **Recovery Options**: Provide actionable next steps
5. **Learning**: Help users avoid similar issues

#### Error Context Examples:
```typescript
// Good error context
throw new ValidationError(
  'Task description too short',
  {
    received: taskDescription,
    minimum: 10,
    suggestion: 'Try: "Create a function that validates email addresses"'
  }
);

// Bad error context
throw new Error('Invalid input');
```
