# Phase 10.4: Jest Configuration Optimization

## High-Level Goal

Optimize Jest configuration and test infrastructure to ensure reliable, efficient execution of interactive CLI tests while maintaining full compatibility with existing unit and integration tests.

## Detailed Context and Rationale

### Why This Phase Exists

Following the successful resolution of interactive CLI testing architecture conflicts in Phase 10.1 and the implementation of comprehensive CLI test suites in Phase 10.2, the current Jest configuration is optimized for traditional unit and integration tests but lacks the specialized settings required for reliable CLI testing. Interactive CLI tests have different characteristics:

- **Longer execution times** due to process spawning and interactive input simulation
- **Resource cleanup requirements** to prevent hanging processes and memory leaks
- **Different timeout needs** compared to synchronous unit tests
- **Process isolation requirements** to prevent test contamination
- **CI/CD integration challenges** due to interactive nature

This phase addresses these CLI-specific testing requirements while preserving the reliability of existing test infrastructure.

### Technical Justification

From the Phoenix-Code-Lite Technical Specification: *"Test-Driven Development is **mandatory** for all Phoenix Code Lite development. This ensures code quality, maintainability, and user confidence in the system."*

The current Jest configuration was designed for traditional unit testing patterns and doesn't account for the unique challenges of interactive CLI testing identified in Phase 10.1:

- **Process lifecycle management**: CLI tests spawn child processes that require proper cleanup
- **Resource management**: Interactive tests create file handles, network connections, and timers that must be properly disposed
- **Timeout optimization**: CLI tests need longer timeouts than unit tests but shorter than integration tests
- **Test isolation**: Interactive tests must not interfere with each other or the test runner

### Architecture Integration

This phase implements the **"Code as Data"** principle from Phoenix Architecture by creating explicit test configuration contracts through Jest configuration, enabling better testability and maintainability. The optimization follows StateFlow principles by establishing clear test execution states with proper cleanup transitions.

## Prerequisites & Verification

### Prerequisites from Phase 10.3

Based on Phase 10.3's completion status, verify the following exist:

- [x] **Interactive CLI testing architecture resolved** with comprehensive solution from Phase 10.1
- [x] **Comprehensive CLI test suite implemented** from Phase 10.2 with 100% success rate
- [x] **Process cleanup patterns established** with 50% handle reduction achieved
- [x] **Enhanced logue wrapper operational** with proper resource management
- [x] **Dependency injection refactor completed** with 31 tests passing and new architecture operational

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Verify Phase 10.3 dependency injection completion status
cd phoenix-code-lite
npm run build
npm test

# Verify dependency injection unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Verify current CLI test functionality
npm run test:cli

# Verify Jest configuration current state
cat jest.config.js

# Verify new dependency injection architecture
node dist/src/index-di.js --help
```

### Expected Results

- All Phase 10.3 dependency injection tests pass consistently (31 tests)
- CLI tests execute successfully but may have optimization opportunities
- Current Jest configuration is functional but not optimized for dependency injection patterns
- Integration tests may fail due to timeout and output pattern changes from Phase 10.3
- Ready for Jest configuration optimization implementation

## Knowledge Transfer from Phase 10.3: Dependency Injection Refactor

### Critical Insights for Jest Configuration Optimization

Based on the successful implementation of dependency injection patterns in Phase 10.3, the following insights are critical for optimizing Jest configuration:

#### **Integration Test Challenges Identified**

**Timeout Issues**: The Phase 10.3 implementation revealed that many integration tests failed due to timeout issues. The new dependency injection architecture introduced additional initialization overhead (~50ms startup time) that existing integration tests weren't designed to handle.

**Expected Output Changes**: Integration tests failed because the refactored CLI commands now produce different output patterns. For example, `ConfigCommand` was simplified to print "Configuration loaded successfully" instead of detailed JSON output, causing test failures.

**Process Exit Behavior**: The new architecture changed how commands handle process exits, requiring updates to integration test expectations around exit codes and cleanup behavior.

#### **Mock Strategy Enhancements Needed**

**Console Output Capture Complexity**: Phase 10.3 revealed that capturing `console.log` output in tests required multiple iterations to get right. The initial implementation only captured `process.stdout.write` but missed `console.log` calls, leading to test failures.

**Process Exit Mocking**: Proper mocking of `process.exit` required careful type casting in TypeScript to avoid compilation errors while maintaining test functionality.

**State Management in Mocks**: Mock implementations needed to track both method calls and state changes to enable comprehensive testing of the new dependency injection patterns.

#### **Performance Considerations for Jest Configuration**

**Dependency Injection Overhead**: The new architecture added ~2-3ms per command instantiation and ~50ms to CLI startup time. Jest configuration must account for these timing changes in timeout settings.

**Memory Usage Patterns**: Mock implementations used more memory than expected due to call history tracking. Jest configuration should optimize memory usage for long-running test suites.

**Factory Pattern Initialization**: The `CommandFactory` pattern introduced additional initialization time that affects test execution patterns.

#### **Testing Architecture Insights**

**Interface Contract Testing**: Phase 10.3 demonstrated the importance of testing interface contracts before implementing concrete classes. Jest configuration should support rapid iteration of interface testing.

**Mock Reliability**: Comprehensive mock implementations with call history tracking proved essential for reliable testing. Jest configuration should optimize for mock-heavy test suites.

**Isolation Requirements**: The new dependency injection architecture requires better test isolation to prevent mock state contamination between tests.

### Specific Recommendations for Phase 10.4

#### **Jest Configuration Optimizations**

1. **Timeout Strategy**: 
   - Increase default timeout for CLI tests to 30-45 seconds to accommodate dependency injection overhead
   - Implement test-specific timeout helpers for different test types (unit vs integration vs CLI)
   - Add timeout configuration for mock-heavy tests that require more setup time

2. **Process Management**:
   - Configure `--detectOpenHandles` for all CLI tests to identify cleanup issues
   - Implement proper cleanup procedures for mock state and console output capture
   - Add process isolation settings to prevent test contamination

3. **Memory Optimization**:
   - Configure Jest to handle memory-intensive mock implementations
   - Implement garbage collection hints for long-running test suites
   - Add memory monitoring for tests with extensive call history tracking

#### **Test Script Organization**

1. **Separate Test Categories**:
   - `test:unit` - Fast unit tests with minimal dependencies
   - `test:integration` - Integration tests with dependency injection patterns
   - `test:cli` - CLI-specific tests with longer timeouts and process management
   - `test:di` - Dependency injection specific tests for interface contracts

2. **Mock-Specific Testing**:
   - `test:mocks` - Tests for mock implementations and their reliability
   - `test:adapters` - Tests for adapter pattern implementations
   - `test:factory` - Tests for factory pattern and dependency management

#### **Integration Test Refactoring Strategy**

1. **Update Expected Outputs**: Modify integration tests to expect the new simplified output patterns from refactored commands
2. **Adjust Timeout Expectations**: Increase timeout values to accommodate dependency injection overhead
3. **Update Process Exit Handling**: Modify tests to handle the new process exit patterns from the dependency injection architecture
4. **Mock Integration**: Update integration tests to work with the new mock implementations and adapter patterns

#### **Performance Monitoring**

1. **Benchmark Integration Tests**: Add performance benchmarks to track the impact of dependency injection on test execution time
2. **Memory Usage Tracking**: Monitor memory usage patterns in long-running test suites
3. **Startup Time Optimization**: Measure and optimize CLI startup time impact on test execution

### Implementation Priority

**High Priority**:
- Update Jest timeout configuration for dependency injection overhead
- Implement proper process cleanup for CLI tests
- Refactor integration tests to work with new output patterns

**Medium Priority**:
- Add memory optimization for mock-heavy test suites
- Implement test-specific timeout helpers
- Add performance monitoring for test execution

**Low Priority**:
- Advanced mock strategy enhancements
- Comprehensive test categorization
- Memory usage optimization

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD) First - Jest Configuration Validation

**Test Name**: "Phase 10.4 Jest Configuration Optimization Validation"

Create comprehensive tests that validate Jest configuration changes:

```typescript
// tests/unit/jest-configuration.test.ts
describe('Jest Configuration Optimization', () => {
  test('CLI tests execute with optimized timeouts', async () => {
    // Test that CLI tests have appropriate timeout settings
    const cliTestTimeout = 30000; // 30 seconds for interactive tests
    expect(cliTestTimeout).toBeGreaterThan(5000); // Unit test default
    expect(cliTestTimeout).toBeLessThan(60000); // Integration test max
  });

  test('Test scripts are properly separated', () => {
    // Validate package.json has separate test scripts
    const packageJson = require('../../package.json');
    expect(packageJson.scripts['test:cli']).toBeDefined();
    expect(packageJson.scripts['test:unit']).toBeDefined();
    expect(packageJson.scripts['test:integration']).toBeDefined();
  });

  test('CLI tests run in isolation', async () => {
    // Verify CLI tests don't interfere with each other
    const testResults = await runCLITests(['config', 'help', 'version']);
    expect(testResults.every(result => result.success)).toBe(true);
  });

  test('Resource cleanup is effective', async () => {
    // Verify no hanging processes after CLI tests
    const initialHandles = getOpenHandles();
    await runCLITests(['config']);
    const finalHandles = getOpenHandles();
    expect(finalHandles.length).toBeLessThanOrEqual(initialHandles.length);
  });
});
```

### 2. Update Jest Configuration for CLI Testing

**Objective**: Enhance `jest.config.js` with CLI-specific optimizations while preserving existing functionality.

**Implementation Steps**:

```javascript
// jest.config.js - Enhanced Configuration
module.exports = {
  // Existing configuration preserved
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  roots: ['<rootDir>/src', '<rootDir>/tests'],
  
  // CLI-specific optimizations
  testTimeout: 30000, // Increased for interactive tests
  maxWorkers: 1, // Force sequential execution for CLI tests
  detectOpenHandles: true, // Identify hanging processes
  forceExit: false, // Let tests clean up naturally
  
  // Test pattern organization
  testMatch: [
    '<rootDir>/tests/unit/**/*.test.ts',
    '<rootDir>/tests/integration/**/*.test.ts',
    '<rootDir>/tests/cli/**/*.test.ts'
  ],
  
  // CLI test specific settings
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/tests/setup/cli-test-setup.ts'],
  
  // Coverage optimization
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    'src/**/*.ts',
    '!src/**/*.d.ts',
    '!src/testing/**',
    '!src/cli/**' // CLI tests don't need coverage
  ],
  
  // Performance optimizations
  cache: true,
  cacheDirectory: '<rootDir>/.jest-cache',
  
  // Verbose output for debugging
  verbose: true,
  silent: false
};
```

### 3. Create Separate Test Scripts

**Objective**: Organize test execution into logical categories for better development workflow.

**Implementation Steps**:

```json
// package.json - Enhanced Test Scripts
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:unit": "jest tests/unit --maxWorkers=4",
    "test:integration": "jest tests/integration --runInBand",
    "test:cli": "jest tests/integration/cli-*.test.ts --runInBand --detectOpenHandles",
    "test:all": "npm run test:unit && npm run test:integration && npm run test:cli",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "test:debug": "jest --detectOpenHandles --verbose"
  }
}
```

### 4. Configure Test Timeouts for Interactive Tests

**Objective**: Establish appropriate timeout strategies for different test types.

**Implementation Steps**:

```typescript
// tests/setup/cli-test-setup.ts
import { jest } from '@jest/globals';

// CLI test specific timeout configuration
beforeAll(() => {
  // Set longer timeout for CLI tests
  jest.setTimeout(30000);
  
  // Configure process cleanup
  process.on('exit', () => {
    // Ensure cleanup on process exit
    cleanupTestResources();
  });
});

afterAll(async () => {
  // Force cleanup after all tests
  await cleanupTestResources();
});

// Test-specific timeout helpers
export const withCLITimeout = (testFn: () => Promise<void>, timeout = 30000) => {
  return async () => {
    const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('CLI test timeout')), timeout);
    });
    
    await Promise.race([
      testFn(),
      timeoutPromise
    ]);
  };
};
```

### 5. Implement Proper Test Cleanup Procedures

**Objective**: Ensure comprehensive resource cleanup to prevent test contamination and hanging processes.

**Implementation Steps**:

```typescript
// tests/utils/test-cleanup.ts
export class TestCleanupManager {
  private static cleanupTasks: (() => Promise<void>)[] = [];
  private static intervals: NodeJS.Timeout[] = [];
  private static processes: NodeJS.Process[] = [];

  static registerCleanup(task: () => Promise<void>): void {
    this.cleanupTasks.push(task);
  }

  static registerInterval(interval: NodeJS.Timeout): void {
    this.intervals.push(interval);
  }

  static registerProcess(process: NodeJS.Process): void {
    this.processes.push(process);
  }

  static async performCleanup(): Promise<void> {
    // Clear all intervals
    this.intervals.forEach(interval => clearInterval(interval));
    this.intervals = [];

    // Terminate all child processes
    this.processes.forEach(process => {
      if (!process.killed) {
        process.kill('SIGTERM');
      }
    });
    this.processes = [];

    // Execute cleanup tasks
    await Promise.all(this.cleanupTasks.map(task => task()));
    this.cleanupTasks = [];
  }
}

// Integration with Jest
beforeEach(() => {
  // Reset cleanup state before each test
  TestCleanupManager.performCleanup();
});

afterEach(async () => {
  // Perform cleanup after each test
  await TestCleanupManager.performCleanup();
});
```

### 6. Add CI/CD Integration for CLI Tests

**Objective**: Ensure CLI tests run reliably in automated environments.

**Implementation Steps**:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml - Enhanced CI Configuration
name: Test Suite

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Build project
      run: npm run build
    
    - name: Run unit tests
      run: npm run test:unit
    
    - name: Run integration tests
      run: npm run test:integration
      timeout-minutes: 10
    
    - name: Run CLI tests
      run: npm run test:cli
      timeout-minutes: 15
      env:
        NODE_ENV: test
        CI: true
    
    - name: Run full test suite
      run: npm run test:all
      timeout-minutes: 20
```

### 7. Validation & Testing

**Objective**: Verify that all Jest configuration optimizations work correctly and don't regress existing functionality.

**Validation Steps**:

```bash
# Validate Jest configuration
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration  
npm run test:cli
npm run test:all

# Verify no regressions
npm run test:coverage

# Test CI/CD simulation
npm run test:debug
```

## Implementation Documentation & Phase Transition

### Phase-Specific Challenges

**Jest Configuration Complexity**: Balancing CLI test requirements with existing test infrastructure required careful analysis of Jest's configuration options and their interactions.

**Process Cleanup Integration**: Integrating the cleanup procedures from Phase 10.1 into Jest's lifecycle required understanding of Jest's beforeAll/afterAll hooks and process management.

**Timeout Strategy Development**: Determining appropriate timeout values for different test types required empirical testing and analysis of actual CLI test execution patterns.

### Tool/Framework Issues

**Jest Worker Management**: The `--runInBand` flag was essential for CLI tests but required careful configuration to prevent performance degradation of unit tests.

**Process Detection**: Jest's `--detectOpenHandles` feature was critical for identifying cleanup issues but required interpretation of the output to distinguish between legitimate and problematic handles.

**Configuration Inheritance**: Ensuring that CLI-specific settings didn't interfere with existing test patterns required careful configuration structure and validation.

### Performance Considerations

**Test Execution Time**: CLI tests naturally take longer than unit tests, requiring timeout optimization to balance reliability with development velocity.

**Resource Usage**: Interactive tests consume more memory and CPU, necessitating proper cleanup to prevent resource exhaustion in CI/CD environments.

**Parallel Execution**: CLI tests must run sequentially to prevent interference, requiring different worker configuration than unit tests.

### Testing Strategy Results

**Configuration Testing**: Created comprehensive tests to validate Jest configuration changes, ensuring that optimizations don't break existing functionality.

**Integration Testing**: Verified that CLI tests work correctly with the new configuration while maintaining compatibility with existing test patterns.

**Performance Testing**: Measured actual execution times and resource usage to optimize timeout and cleanup settings.

### Security/Quality Findings

**Process Isolation**: Proper cleanup procedures prevent test contamination and ensure security isolation between test runs.

**Resource Management**: Enhanced cleanup prevents memory leaks and file handle exhaustion in long-running test suites.

**Error Handling**: Robust error handling in cleanup procedures ensures tests fail gracefully rather than hanging indefinitely.

### User Experience Feedback

**Developer Workflow**: Separate test scripts provide clear, intuitive commands for different testing scenarios.

**Debugging Capability**: Enhanced verbose output and process detection make it easier to diagnose test failures.

**CI/CD Integration**: Reliable automated testing improves confidence in code changes and deployment processes.

### Additional Insights & Discoveries

**Jest Configuration Patterns**: Discovered optimal patterns for mixing different test types in a single Jest configuration while maintaining performance and reliability.

**Process Lifecycle Management**: Developed comprehensive understanding of Node.js process management in testing environments.

**Test Organization Strategy**: Established clear separation between unit, integration, and CLI tests that scales with project growth.

### Recommendations for Phase 10.5

**Advanced Interactive Testing**: The optimized Jest configuration provides a solid foundation for implementing more complex interactive workflows and multi-step CLI testing scenarios.

**Performance Monitoring**: Consider adding performance monitoring to track test execution times and identify optimization opportunities over time.

**Test Parallelization**: Explore opportunities for parallel execution of non-interactive CLI tests while maintaining the sequential execution requirement for interactive tests.

**Enhanced Debugging**: Implement more sophisticated debugging tools for CLI tests, including step-by-step execution and state inspection capabilities.
